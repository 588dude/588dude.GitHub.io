    <p>Hello, my name is Jake. I have always been fascinated by technology and with helping others. I have over 8 years of customer service experience.
        5 of those years are from Geek Squad. I started in the warehouse at Best Buy then moved to Asset Protection for 1 year 2 months, while I was
    working as Asset Protection I wanted to help customers with their computers. I then moved to Geek Squad as a consultation agent for 3 years 2 months.
    Throughout my time at Geek Squad I developed my best strategies for customer service, troubleshooting and conflict resolution and trained 8 of my fellow agents
on my strategies for best practices. From there I became a cadet to perform work in client's homes and help other agents. I then became an in home agent and performed
the work myself to help support my team and have trained 2 cadets while I was an agent. </p>
