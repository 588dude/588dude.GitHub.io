      <p>
        Hello, my name is Jake. I have always been fascinated by technology and
        with helping others. I have over 8 years of customer service experience.
        5 of those years are from Geek Squad. I started in the warehouse at Best
        Buy then moved to Asset Protection for 1 year 2 months, while I was
        working as Asset Protection I wanted to help customers with their
        computers. I then moved to Geek Squad as a consultation agent for 3
        years 2 months. Throughout my time at Geek Squad I developed my best
        strategies for customer service, troubleshooting and conflict resolution
        and trained 8 of my fellow agents on my strategies for best practices.
        From there I became a cadet to perform work in client's homes and help
        other agents. I then became an in home agent and performed the work
        myself to help support my team and have trained 2 cadets while I was an
        agent and in homes for over 2 years. I am currently seeking Information
        Technology internships and other Information Technology opportunities. I
        see my future in networking or security or a combination of the both. To
        know more about me check out
